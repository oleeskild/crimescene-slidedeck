<!--Remember to tell and show them to go to the cheatsheet and click the github stuff -->
<v-clicks>

- 1. Use commit message history
- 2. Count the total number of times each file has changed
- 3. Count lines of code in each file
- 4. Combine these two
- 5. Visualize the results 
- 6. Expect to be confused! üòµ‚Äçüí´

<!--
It's not obvious why this is useful. 
Ask them if anyone can think of why its nice.
Mention that it's no use in refactoring stable legacy code
Mention that its a nice way to quickly see which files are important

# Excercises - Hotspots

- In your github codespace, open up the Excercises/Part 2 - Hotspots, 
and do the excercises there. 

It's not expected that you complete them all. 
We will have a discussion about it afterwards

  <div class="text-left">
    <p class="mb-4">Areas of code that are:</p>
    <v-clicks>
    <ul>
      <li>Frequently changed</li>
      <li>Complex and hard to understand</li>
      <li>Often involved in bugs</li>

# Counting lines of codes seems too easy

<v-clicks>

- Simple and intuitive
- Performs as well as more elaborate metrics
- > Multiple studies has shown that it performs at the level of more complicated metrics
- It's language neutral

# Bugs Breed Bugs: The Power Law

<li>The hotspots comprised only 4 % of the code, yet that code

<li>Research shows that </li>

# Code reviews

<v-clicks>

- Research shows that code reviews removes defects üëè
- But ... they are time-consuming ‚è≥
- Use hotpots to identify modules were deeper reviews are good time-investment üîç

# Temporal dependencies
## Or change coupling

<!--Example of what coupling is-->

# Explicit dependencies 

```ts{1-6|8-11|8-15|all}
// payment.ts
export class Payment {
  pay(amount: number) {
    console.log(`Paid $${amount}`);
  }
}

// order.ts
import { Payment } from "./payment";

const payment = new Payment();

export function placeOrder() {
  payment.pay(100); // Direct, explicit call
}
```

# Implicit dependencies

```ts
// payment.ts
export class Payment {
  pay(amount: number) {
    console.log(`Paid $${amount}`);
  }

export function placeOrder() {

}

// payment.ts
import { onOrderPlaced } from "./bus";
onOrderPlaced(data => {
  console.log(`(Implicit) Paid $${data.amount}`);
});

```

## Reasons 
- Copy-paste - DRY is violated. Easy to address 
- Communication via message bus, network or event 
- Bad encapsulation - Multiple modules needs changing because of low cohesion
- Producer-consumer - Not neccessarily bad

### Degree of coupling between LoginCiew.cshtml and OrderAppService.cs?

<br/>

<v-clicks>

# 50%

</v-clicks>


---

# More advanced change coupling algorithms

<v-clicks>

- Time window and author
- Smart commits works across repos and authors ‚≠êÔ∏è

</v-clicks>

---

# Sum of Coupling

- Counts number of other co-changed files
- Reveals what the system _really_ is about from an architectural perspective

# Show code-maat usage
### Couling Analysis in code-maat
```bash
code-maat -l git_log.txt -c git2 -a coupling | grep -v '\.json' | grep -v '__tests__' > coupling.csv
```

#### Outputs
```bash
entity,coupled,degree,average-revs
packages/dts-test/componentTypeHelpers.test-d.tsx,packages/runtime-core/src/componentTypeHelpers.ts,77,9
packages/runtime-vapor/src/dom/style.ts,packages/runtime-vapor/src/metadata.ts,71,7
packages/compiler-vapor/src/generators/dom.ts,packages/compiler-vapor/src/generators/html.ts,70,9
```
<br/>

### SOC analysis in code-maat
```bash
code-maat -l git_log.txt -c git2 -a soc > soc.csv
```

#### Output 
```bash
entity,soc
packages/runtime-vapor/src/component.ts,876
packages/runtime-vapor/src/index.ts,834
packages/compiler-vapor/__tests__/__snapshots__/compile.spec.ts.snap,754
CHANGELOG.md,698
